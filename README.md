# Ridge Regression for Time-Series Forecasting

This repository contains my implementation of ridge regression for univariate time-series prediction using three solvers, all in **pure NumPy**:

- **Closed-form (normal equations)**
- **Cholesky decomposition**
- **Conjugate Gradient (CG)**

## Environment
- Python 3.10  
- Install:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
